# YJIT Metrics

## About this Repo

The code in this repo is intended to check speedups and internal YJIT statistics for
YJIT benchmarks in the [yjit-bench repository](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-bench).
We hope to use it as part of a nightly run, generating and exporting data about
YJIT's progress on a variety of Ruby metrics.

## How to Use this Repo

For now, you can run ./basic_benchmark.rb to clone appropriate other repositories (yjit, yjit-bench) and run a simple benchmark.
